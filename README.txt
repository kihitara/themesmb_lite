***************************************

This is a version of the
Themes.MoodleBites.com Theme that has
the extra block regions removed. For use
with Moodle 2.3 and 2.4 until the custom
block regions issue is resolved.

***************************************

To put content in the slider, open
slidercontent/content.htm and edit
that file.

Each slide of content must be contained
within the tags
<div class="contentdiv">CONTENT HERE </div>

Anything placed within that must use inline
styling.

For ease of use, keep all images and
other files used in the slidercontent
folder within the theme.

You can make up to nine slides at any
one time. They are numbered automatically.
